# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- `npm run build` — Rollup build → ESM, UMD, and minified UMD bundles in `dist/`
- `npm run dev` — Rollup watch mode (rebuilds on save)
- `npm run lint` — ESLint on `src/`
- `npm run format` — Prettier write on `src/**/*.{ts,css}`
- `npm run format:check` — Prettier check (CI-friendly)
- Demo: serve the repo root (e.g. `npx serve .`) and open `/demo/index.html`

## Code Structure

- `src/index.ts` — Entry point. Exports `Lightbox` class, auto-initializes on `[data-lightbox]` elements.
- `src/lightbox.ts` — Core `Lightbox` class: open/close morph, zoom, pan with momentum, preloading. All animation via rAF + spring physics.
- `src/physics/spring.ts` — Damped harmonic oscillator (`springStep`) using semi-implicit Euler integration. Spring presets and types.
- `src/style.css` — Overlay/backdrop/image styles, chrome UI (caption bar, close button, nav arrows, counter). Extracted to `dist/lightbox3.css` by PostCSS.

## Vocabulary

Use these terms consistently in code, comments, and conversation.

### Views (what the user sees)

- **closed** — No overlay, thumbnails only
- **opened** — Image visible, fit to viewport (`scale === 1`)
- **zoomed** — Image at native/larger scale (`scale > 1`), pannable
- **navigating** — Gallery mode, viewing one image in a multi-image set

### Transitions (animated movements between views)

- **opening** — closed → opened
- **closing** — opened → closed (FLIP morph back to thumbnail, or fade for text links)
- **dismissing** — opened → closed via vertical swipe (velocity-based commit/snap-back)
- **zooming in** — opened → zoomed
- **zooming out** — zoomed → opened
- **navigating** — opened → opened (next/prev image in gallery, strip slides laterally)

### Gestures (user-driven, in progress)

- **panning** — dragging while zoomed
- **momentum** — post-release glide (spring-driven)
- **snap-back** — rubber-band return to pan bounds
- **swiping** — horizontal swipe to navigate gallery (prev/next)
- **pinching** — two-finger pinch-to-zoom on touch devices
- **dismiss drag** — vertical drag to close (swipe-to-dismiss)
- **rubber-band bounce** — spring bounce at gallery edges when no more images

### Systems (internal engines)

- **spring engine** — rAF loop + `springStep()` that drives all animations
- **FLIP morph** — open/close technique (measure thumb → measure target → animate the delta)
- **preloader** — hover-triggered image prefetch
- **strip** — slide container (`lightbox3-strip`) holding current + adjacent slides for gallery navigation. Translated horizontally via spring for swipe/nav transitions.
- **chrome UI** — bottom caption bar (caption, counter, close button) + side nav arrows. Opacity animated via its own spring. Hidden when zoomed or single image.
- **dismiss gesture** — vertical swipe-to-dismiss system with velocity tracking, rubber-band resistance, and commit/snap-back threshold

## Animation Architecture

**Use `requestAnimationFrame` + spring physics for all animations and gestures.** Do not use the Web Animations API (WAAPI) or CSS transitions.

### Why

- **Single system**: One spring engine drives everything — open/close morph, zoom, pan momentum, snap-back. No mixing of animation paradigms.
- **Interruptible**: Any animation can be grabbed mid-flight. A user can catch an image during momentum, during a zoom transition, etc. rAF loops cancel cleanly; WAAPI `fill: forwards` creates layer priority conflicts with inline styles.
- **Velocity-aware**: Release velocity from gestures feeds directly into the spring's initial velocity. WAAPI has no concept of this — you'd need to pre-compute the entire curve.
- **Compositor-friendly**: All interactive animations use `transform` only (translate + scale), which stays on the GPU compositor thread.

### Interruptibility

**All animations must be interruptible.** A user must be able to grab, tap, or redirect any in-progress animation at any time. Never lock out input while an animation is running.

- Before starting any new animation, call `stopSpring()` to cancel the current rAF loop.
- Read the current spring state (position + velocity) as the starting point for the new animation — don't snap to a predefined start.
- Never use `isAnimating` as a gate that blocks user input during gestures. It should only prevent conflicting *programmatic* transitions (e.g. open during close), not block pointer events.

### Completion-only flags are traps

Never use a boolean that is only set on animation *completion* (e.g. `zoomed`) to gate user input. These flags create dead windows where clicks/taps are silently swallowed for the entire duration of the animation.

- **`zoomed`** is `true` only after zoom-in finishes and stays `true` until zoom-out finishes. During the zoom-out animation it is still `true`, so any check like `if (this.zoom.zoomed) return` blocks input for the entire transition.
- To check "is a zoom in effect right now (idle or animating)?" test the live spring state: `this.zoom.zoomed || this.zoom.scale !== 1`.
- Same principle applies to `isOpen` — set it when the action *begins* (overlay created), not when the animation lands.

### Side-effects must not live in onComplete

Never put essential side-effects (image loading, state transitions) inside an animation's `onComplete` callback. If the animation is interrupted, the callback never fires and the side-effect is lost. Start async work (e.g. full-res image load) immediately and guard the result with a check that the lightbox is still showing the relevant content.

### Async callbacks must guard against closed/closing state

Image loads (`.then()`, `addEventListener('load', …)`), timers (`setTimeout`), and other deferred work can resolve after the user has started closing or already closed the lightbox. Every async callback that touches DOM elements or modifies lightbox state must bail out early if the lightbox is no longer active:

```ts
if (this.state.isClosing || !this.state.isOpen) return;
```

Without this, a late-arriving image load can reposition/resize the image mid-close, causing visual glitches. The `currentSrc` check alone is not sufficient — it stays valid throughout the close animation.

### Spring long tail

Springs settle mathematically long after they are visually done — position and velocity creep toward zero but take many extra frames to cross the threshold. Never wait for full settlement to perform DOM cleanup or state transitions that the user can perceive.

- For close animations, use an `earlyComplete` check (e.g. `opacity < 0.01`) to remove the overlay as soon as it's invisible, not when every spring has settled.
- For zoom-in, allow panning as soon as `scale > 1` rather than waiting for the zoom spring to fully settle.

### Pointer event ordering

Browser event order is: `pointerdown` → `pointermove` → `pointerup` → `click`. State read in one handler must survive until later handlers in the same sequence have consumed it.

- `dragMoved` must stay `true` through the `click` handler so it can suppress the click. Clear it *in the click handler* after checking it, not in `pointerup`.

### Reentrant transitions

A transition (e.g. close) must not restart itself when the user repeats the triggering input (e.g. pressing ESC multiple times). Use a dedicated flag (`isClosing`) to guard against re-entry. The flag is set when the transition begins and cleared only in the final cleanup (`finishClose`).

### Overlay must not block during exit

The overlay sits above the page and captures all pointer events. During the close animation, set `pointer-events: none` on the overlay so clicks pass through to thumbnails underneath. This lets the user click a new thumbnail to interrupt the close and immediately open a new image.

### How it works

- `springStep()` is the core: a damped harmonic oscillator stepped via semi-implicit Euler integration
- Each animated property gets its own `SpringState` (position + velocity)
- A single `requestAnimationFrame` loop ticks all active springs each frame
- Springs self-terminate when position and velocity are within threshold of target

## Tests

No tests for now. Do not add or suggest tests.

### Spring presets

Exported from `spring.ts`:
- `SPRING_OPEN` (stiffness: 260, damping: 26) — zoom in
- `SPRING_CLOSE` (stiffness: 500, damping: 38) — zoom out

Defined locally in `lightbox.ts`:
- `PAN_SPRING` (stiffness: 170, damping: 26) — pan momentum, strip slide animation (softer, more glide)
- `SNAP_SPRING` (stiffness: 300, damping: 30) — rubber band snap-back, swipe snap-back (stiffer)
- `PRESS_SPRING` (stiffness: 300, damping: 20) — button press feedback animation
